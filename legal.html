    <h1>LEGAL BOILERPLATE — Astral Operations Division</h1>

    <p><strong>Binding Multiversal Contract · Clause Set 77-Ξ</strong> (“Expendable Asset Provision”)</p>

    <p>
      By acknowledging this communiqué, the recipient (“Operative”) consents to the following terms, conditions,
      waivers, and existential forfeitures as mandated by the Astral Operations Division and its undisclosed stakeholders (“The Benefactor”):
    </p>

    <h2>1. Liability Waiver</h2>
    <p>
      The Operative agrees that all physical, metaphysical, psychic, soul-bound, and reincarnative damages incurred during or after the mission
      are self-inflicted and non-actionable. No compensation is owed for loss of limb, life, lineage, or lingering hauntings.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Existence-for-Use Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      The Operative’s continued existence constitutes acceptance of conscription. Refusal to participate may result in temporal freezing,
      planar repossession, or administrative erasure without further notice.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Confidentiality Clause</h2>
    <p>
      Operative acknowledges that discussing, remembering, or dreaming of mission details is a Class-Ω infraction.
      Violators will be re-classified as “Loose Variables” and handled accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Ownership of Recovered Assets</h2>
    <p>
      All objects, entities, knowledge, echoes, or unintended horrors retrieved from the vault are property of The Benefactor.
      Any attempt to claim, leverage, bond with, worship, or otherwise utilize acquired items is strictly prohibited and punishable under Codex 13:
      “Unauthorized Enlightenment.”
    </p>

    <h2>5. Non-Disparagement</h2>
    <p>
      Operative agrees not to speak ill of The Benefactor, their subsidiaries, their shadow proxies, or any eldritch intermediaries acting
      on their behalf, as such speech may destabilize multiple timelines.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Termination Clause</h2>
    <p>
      The Benefactor reserves the right to terminate the Operative at any moment, for any reason, including but not limited to:
      mission failure, mission success, inconvenient curiosity, or statistical necessity. Termination may be physical, contractual, or ontological.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Post-Mission Containment</h2>
    <p>
      Surviving Operatives will undergo mandatory debriefing, memory review, and optional identity restructuring. Long-term containment plans may apply.
      Appeals are not recognized.
    </p>

    <p>
      By proceeding past this message, Operative confirms full compliance and acknowledges that failure to comply is impossible by design.
    </p>
